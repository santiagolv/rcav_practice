    <p class="lead">Our little calculator has an infinite number of resources available for you. The resources all live at URLs according to the following scheme:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The square of a particular NUMBER lives at the URL <code>/square/NUMBER</code></li>
      <li>The square root of a particular NUMBER lives at the URL <code>/square_root/NUMBER</code></li>
      <li>A random number within a range, MIN to MAX, lives at the URL <code>/random/MIN/MAX</code></li>
      <li>
        The monthly loan payment, given an <strong>annual interest rate in basis points, or hundredths of a percent</strong>, a number of years, and a principal amount, lives at the URL
        <code>/payment/INTEREST_RATE/NUMBER_OF_YEARS/PRINCIPAL_VALUE</code>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>For example, if you visit <a href="http://localhost:3000/square_root/8">http://localhost:3000/square_root/8</a>, you should see something like</p>

    <blockquote>
      <div class="page-header">
        <h1>Square Root</h1>
      </div>

      <p class="lead">The square root of 8.0 is 2.83.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>If you visit <a href="http://localhost:3000/random/50/100">http://localhost:3000/random/50/100</a>, you should see something like</p>

    <blockquote>
      <div class="page-header">
        <h1>Random Number</h1>
      </div>

      <p class="lead">A random number between 50 and 100 is 87.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>If you visit <a href="http://localhost:3000/payment/410/30/250000">http://localhost:3000/payment/410/30/250000</a>, you should see something like</p>

    <blockquote>
      <div class="page-header">
        <h1>Payment</h1>
      </div>

      <p class="lead">A 30 year loan of $250000, with an annual interest rate of 4.1%, requires a monthly payment of $1208.00.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>All of these should work no matter what I type into the variable segments of the path (as long as I type integers).</strong></p>

    <p>Remember: Rails places all user input in the <code>params</code> hash. You can use the <code>params</code> hash in your actions or your views. Watch the server log to see what the <code>params</code> hash looks like for any given request.</p>

    <h2>Your task: Make all of these URLs work.</h2>
